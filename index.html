            <p class="project-description">Key Skills and Responsibilities:

                Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive analysis of Spotify's music data to identify patterns influencing song success and user preferences.
                Feature Engineering: Developed and refined multiple features, including song attributes, artist information, and user behavior metrics, to enhance model performance.
                Hit Prediction Model: Created a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of a song becoming a hit, utilizing machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy.
                Playlist Creation: Implemented a playlist recommendation system based on user input, suggesting curated playlists that align with user preferences and listening history.
                Pipeline Management: Employed Dagster for orchestrating data workflows, ensuring efficient data processing and model deployment.
                Python Programming: Utilized Python libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas for data manipulation and model development, and integrated Dagster for managing data pipelines.

                Description: In this project, I developed a multi-faceted Spotify features application that included both a hit prediction model and a playlist creation system. The hit prediction model analyzed various song features—such as tempo, genre, and artist attributes—to forecast the potential success of tracks on Spotify. Additionally, the project featured a dynamic playlist recommendation system that generates playlists based on user input, tailoring suggestions to individual listening preferences. The project also incorporated Dagster, a data orchestration tool, to manage and streamline the data processing pipeline. This ensured that the data was processed efficiently and that the models were updated seamlessly. By leveraging machine learning, advanced data processing, and pipeline management, this project demonstrated my ability to create complex, user-centric features and manage sophisticated data workflows effectively.</p>

            <p class="project-description">Key Skills and Responsibilities:

                Data Exploration: Analyzed extensive Uber and Lyft ride data to explore trends, pricing structures, and ride patterns across different locations and times.
                Model Comparison: Tested various regression models to predict ride prices, ultimately finding that the Decision Tree model outperformed others, including linear regression, in terms of R² value.
                Decision Tree Implementation: Developed and fine-tuned a Decision Tree model to improve prediction accuracy for ride prices, providing more actionable insights compared to simpler models.
                Data Visualization: Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings and model performance, making complex data more accessible.
                Jupyter Notebooks: Documented the analysis process and model results in a Jupyter Notebook, allowing for clear presentation and reproducibility of the work.
                Technologies Used: Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks, data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
